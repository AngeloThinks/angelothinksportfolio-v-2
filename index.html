     <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Angelo Giordano Vazquez. I'm from Laredo, Texas, and I currently reside in Conroe, Texas. For an easier reference you can think of it as Houston, TX. Yeehaw...just Kidding.</p>

    <li>Creating, Collaboration, Exploration, and Discovering</li>  

  </ul>

  <h3>Go on...</h3>
  <p>Although I have a passion for music, I found myself always wanting to create more in the digital realm. I went as far as producing music through a program that only uses code for rythms. In my previous line of work, I would always look for ways to make reports easier for my co-workers by implementing code in a master excel file.</p>
</article>

  <p>I realized that I have a strong desire to work with fellow engineers to integrate websites and apps for companies who may have put this priority on the back burner. Through <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> I have been able to act on my ambitions and goals, and I'm happy to work with others who are willing to share the knowledge!</p>
